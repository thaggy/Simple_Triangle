# Simple Triangle Maker
I watched a simple coding challenge video where the solution provided was not very satisfying since it just created a right triangle on its side which is really easy and you can just do in one for loop (example below) so I decided to make something slightly more complicated because I was bored

# Easy Triangle Example
```python
def Triangle(size):
    for i in range(size):
        print('x' * i)
```
This implementation is boring and not as fun but it also technically works
